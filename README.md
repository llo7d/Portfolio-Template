If you dont like videos, here is some text you weirdo:

1.
It comes in two versions react & tailwind or html & tailwind

The html version works just like that, but if you want to customize the theme colour you will need to do

npm install
npm run watch

And then change the main hex colour number and thats it.

React is same thing, npm install and do you thing 21

2.
There is a figma file that contains a 3d character where you can customize colours. [Look at this video here.]([url](https://youtu.be/dZfTGpOufg0?si=cXstSbSKHxLY1w6-&t=263)https://youtu.be/dZfTGpOufg0?si=cXstSbSKHxLY1w6-&t=263) Figma is free, so you just drop the file and export .png images.

3.
Thats about it.
Add your info and portfolio links etc.. and host it anywhere you want.
